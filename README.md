# Codeable

Codeable is an online learn-how-to-code educational platform that simplifies and streamlines the process to actually learn! Send in any youtube video or course, and follow along with a side-by-side python editor and console that runs on your browser.

## Motivation

Learning how to program is quite the process. It involves having multiple components, multiple windows for different tasks. One for the youtube video you're watching, a text editor to type your code, and maybe even a terminal window to run a python console or actually build and run your code! It's something that most tutorials skip over, mostly because it distracts from the actual meat and bones of the tutorial --- where the actual learning and magic of programming happens. Codeable is a one stop shop to run all these tasks and let students focus on simply following along the tutorial and begin building things.

## Info

As of October 26, 2016, Codeable is currently a work in progress although an end-to-end flow in terms of submission of videos has been achieved. I am currently working on establishing sessions for users, and my aim is to add different options for different languages other than python as well. This project is also an exercise for me to practice a proper git workflow, branches, pull requests, merges, code-reviews, etc. So if it seems strange that I'm making pull requests to myself, please understand that I'm working on this project alone, but I want the experience of being able to establish good practices.  A GIF is down below for what it looks like as of October 26, 2016 (a bare bones but fully functional application).
