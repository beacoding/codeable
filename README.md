# Codeable

Codeable is an online learn-how-to-code educational platform that simplifies and streamlines the process to actually learn! Send in any youtube video or course, and follow along with a side-by-side python editor and console that runs on your browser.

## Motivation

Learning how to program is quite the process. It involves having multiple components, multiple windows for different tasks. One for the youtube video you're watching, a text editor to type your code, and maybe even a terminal window to run a python console or actually build and run your code! It's something that most tutorials skip over, mostly because it distracts from the actual meat and bones of the tutorial --- where the actual learning and magic of programming happens. Codeable is a one stop shop to run all these tasks and let students focus on simply following along the tutorial and begin building things.

## Info
As of November 4, 2016, Codeable now has its own theme, is not using trinket.io anymore, is using its own built on top of skulpt (editor) and brython (console). Next steps are creating playlists, searching youtube and adding it to the page, and allowing more modules to be used with the code editor 


## Built With

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - The web framework used
* [SQLite3](https://sqlite.org/) - Database used
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Server
